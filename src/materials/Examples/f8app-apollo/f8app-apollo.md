# F8 App 2016 - Apollo

This is a refactored version of the official [F8](https://fbf8.com/) app of 2016, that uses the [Apollo Stack](http://www.apollostack.com/). As part of the refactor I have made the following changes:

* Removed the use of Relay on both the server and client.
* Replaced the Parse client with the Apollo client for all the data loading.
* Fully implemented all data requirements in the GraphQL server.

The implementation found in the master branch leaves the application architecture intact with the use of react-redux.  There is a version of the app that uses react-apollo in the react-apollo-connect branch which is a WIP.

## Requirements

1. [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) (follow iOS and Android guides)
  - Xcode 7.3 +
2. [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) (only for iOS)
  - Version 1.0+ recommended (`gem install cocoapods --pre`)
3. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads) (needed to run Parse Server locally)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/nnance/f8app-apollo
  $ cd f8app-apollo
  ```

2. **Install dependencies** (npm v3+):

  ```
  $ npm install
  $ (cd ios; pod install)        # only for iOS version
  ```

3. **Make sure MongoDB is running:**

  ```
  $ lsof -iTCP:27017 -sTCP:LISTEN
  ```

  NOTE: if installed with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) run `brew info mongo` and
  check out the Caveats section.

  If you prefer to use an external MongoDB server, set `DATABASE_URI`:

  ```
  $ export DATABASE_URI=mongodb://example-mongo-hosting.com:1337/my-awesome-database
  ```

4. **Start Parse/GraphQL servers:**

  ```
  $ npm start
  ```

5. **Import sample data** (the local Parse Server should be running):

  ```
  $ npm run import-data
  ```

  Make sure everything works by visiting:

  * Parse Dashboard: [http://localhost:8080/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/dashboard)
  * Graph*i*QL: [http://localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:8080/graphql?query=query+%7B%0A++schedule+%7B%0A++++title%0A++++speakers+%7B%0A++++++name%0A++++++title%0A++++%7D%0A++++location+%7B%0A++++++name%0A++++%7D%0A++%7D%0A%7D)

6. **Running on Android**:

  ```
  $ react-native run-android
  $ adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081   # required to ensure the Android app can
  $ adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080   # access the Packager and GraphQL server
  ```


7. **Running on iOS:**

  ```
  $ react-native run-ios
  ```
